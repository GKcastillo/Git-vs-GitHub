        <h1>What is the difference between Git and GitHub</h1>
        <br>
        <p> Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) that tracks changes in source code during software development. It enables developers to work on their local copies of a project, managing different versions of files, tracking modifications, and merging changes. Git is a command-line tool that is installed and run locally on a user's machine.
       </p>
       <br>
    <br>
    <p>In essence, Git is the fundamental tool for version control, while GitHub is a service that leverages Git to provide a collaborative and accessible environment for software development. One can use Git independently without GitHub, but GitHub relies on Git to function.</p>
